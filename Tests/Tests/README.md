There are 8 tests and there supposed output to make sure our project works well.
For the sake of having full information, I thought it would be interesting to put the size of the board in the first line of each output.
This way, it is possible to differentiate 2 games that have the same output but of different board size.

One boat tests :

Test 1:
No boat defined

Test 2:
Move a boat

Test 3:
Rotate a boat right

Test 4:
Rotate a boat left

Test 5:
Shoot a boat


Multiple boats tests :
- I considered the output list should be in the same order as when boats were defined (test 6)
- I considered that a boat can stay in a square where a boat was shoot (test 7)
- I considered two boats could be shoot in the same square (test 8)

Test 6:
The list of outputs has to be consistent

Test 7:
A boat moves over a boat wreck

Test 8:
2 boats were shoot at the same position
